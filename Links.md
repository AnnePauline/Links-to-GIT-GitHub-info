### interactive to try git out, there are a couple of tutorials/puzzles:
* https://try.github.io/ - The official Github mini tutorial, requires a github account for the last couple of exercises, but you donâ€™t need one for most of it.
* http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/ - A series of puzzles to get you used to the kinds of changes you can make to history. Ranges from simple (make a commit) to really complicated (completely rearrange your messy history so that it looks linear)
